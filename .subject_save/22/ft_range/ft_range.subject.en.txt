Write the following function:

int     *ft_range(int start, int end);

It must allocate (with malloc()) an array of integers, fill it with consecutive
values that begin at start and end at end (Including start and end !), then
return a pointer to the first value of the array.

Examples:

- With (1, 3) you will return an array containing 1, 2 and 3.
- With (-1, 2) you will return an array containing -1, 0, 1 and 2.
- With (0, 0) you will return an array containing 0.
- With (0, -3) you will return an array containing 0, -1, -2 and -3.
