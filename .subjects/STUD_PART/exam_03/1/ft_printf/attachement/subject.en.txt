Assignment name  : ft_printf
Expected files   : ft_printf.c
Allowed functions: malloc, free, write, va_start, va_arg, va_copy, va_end
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function named `ft_printf` that will mimic the real printf but 
it will manage only the following conversions: s,d and x.

Your function must be declared as follows:

int ft_printf(const char *, ... );

Before you start we advise you to read the `man 3 printf` and the `man va_arg`.
To test your program compare your results with the true printf.

Exemples of the function output:

call: ft_printf("%s\n", "toto");
out: toto$

call: ft_printf("Magic %s is %d", "number", 42);
out: Magic number is 42%

call: ft_printf("Hexadecimal for %d is %x\n", 42, 42);
out: Hexadecimal for 42 is 2a$

Obs: Your function must not have memory leaks. Moulinette will test that.
