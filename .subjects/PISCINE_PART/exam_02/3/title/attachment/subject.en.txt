--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program called title that takes a string and displays the same string with the first letter of each word capitalized. Words are separated by spaces, and all non-alphabetical characters remain unchanged.

The output should be followed by a newline.

If the number of arguments is not 1, display only a newline.

Examples:

$> ./title "hello world"
Hello World
$> ./title "this is a test"
This Is A Test
$> ./title "this is 42a test"
This Is 42a Test
$> ./title "my title 2024"
My Title 2024
$> ./title "MY TITLE"
MY TITLE
$> ./title "" | cat -e
$
