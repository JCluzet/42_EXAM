--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a function named cycle_detector that takes a const t_list *list
as argument, and check if the given linked list contains no cycles.

A cycle is defined when you go at least twice through the same link, when you
travel inside a linked list.

This function should returnw 1 if it detects a cycle inside the given linked
list, otherwise it returns 0.

This function should be prototyped like this:

    int        cycle_detector(const t_list *list)

The type t_list is:

    typedef struct     s_list
    {
        int            data;
        struct s_list  *next;
    }                  t_list;

This type will be included in a header named "list.h". You don't have to turn-in
your "list.h", we will use ours during the evaluation.
