Write a program that takes an undefined number of arguments which could be 
considered as options and writes on standard output a representation of those
options as groups of bytes followed by a newline.

An option is an argument that begins by a '-' and have multiple characters 
which could be : abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

All options are stocked in a single int and each options represents a bit of that
int, and should be stocked like this : 

00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000

Launch the program without arguments or with the '-h' flag activated must print
an usage on the standard output, as shown in the following examples.

A wrong option must print "Invalid Option" followd by a newline.

Examples :
$>./options
options: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
$>./options -abc -ijk
00000000 00000000 00000111 00000111
$>./options -z
00000010 00000000 00000000 00000000
$>./options -abc -hijk
options: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
$>./options -%
Invalid Option
