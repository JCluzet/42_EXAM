# ❤️ Disclaimer for 42 staff :

This project is not identical to the proposed exams and does not reflect 42 official exam. 
It is only meant to help 42 students to train on some exercises found on Github. 
It works simply by doing a DIFF on both versions. 
All the subjects have been found on Github. During my schooling at 42, this project helped me to understand a lot of notions like to host a website, to do javascript, php and others.
This project has been created with the sole purpose of helping students to understand their mistakes and improve themselves. 
If it’s not the case, I am ready to make changes and corrections on it, 42_EXAM/GradeMe has only a non-lucrative and educational purpose. It is completely free and open-source.

### ⚠️ This project is available on MAC and LINUX (the real exam will be on Linux)
###     ➡ On Linux, 42_EXAM is still on beta, please report any bugs

 # CHEAT code :
 (sorry don't work in exam at 42) : Using command **remove_time** to remove waiting time between two push.
   > The maximum time to complete the exam is only information. Here, the exercise can always be corrected even after the time limit.

 # Launch in ONE COMMAND : 

 ```bash -c "$(curl https://grademe.fr)"```    --> Visit [Grademe.fr](https://grademe.fr)
 
# RGPD Information :
 Some data may be collected for the sole purpose of improving the service, for example to check if an error is coming from the student and not from the program. 
The data that can be collected are : 
- the host name of your machine.
- the time of your push, the name of your exercise
- your code (only in case of failure)

# Your help is welcome

👋 If you have any problem with the test, it would be nice to create an "Issue", it will take 3 minutes of your time and it will help me to make the test accessible to more people.

📌 Remember that if you encounter an error, you are probably not the only one and your "Issue" will surely help other people.
