# Disclaimer for 42 staff :

This project is not identical to the proposed exams and does not reflect 42 official exam. 
It is only meant to help 42 students to train on some exercises found on Github. 
It works simply by doing a DIFF on both versions. 
All the subjects have been found on Github. During my schooling at 42, this project helped me to understand a lot of notions like how to host a website, working with javascript, php and others.
This project has been created with the sole purpose of helping students to understand their mistakes and improve themselves. 
If It’s not the case, I am ready to make changes and corrections on it, 42_EXAM/GradeMe has only a non-lucrative and educational purpose. It is completely free and open-source. 


# Your help is welcome

👋 If you have any problem with any test, please create an "Issue" here on Github, it will only take 3 minutes of your time and it will help me to make the test more accurate.
