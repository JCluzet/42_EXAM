# ❤️ Disclaimer for 42 staff :

This project is not identical to the proposed exams and does not reflect your exams at 42.
It is only meant to help 42 students to revise some exercises found on Github. 
It works simply by doing a DIFF on both versions.
All the subjects have been found on this [Github](https://github.com/markveligod/examrank-02-03-04-05-06). 

This project has been created with the sole of helping students understand their mistakes and improve herself, if it does not go in this direction I am ready to make changes on it.

## ⚠️ This project is available on MAC and LINUX (the real exam will be on Linux)
###     ➡ On Linux, 42_EXAM is on beta, please report any bugs

 ## Practice like for the 42 exam 🏊‍♂️

 # CHEAT code :
 (sorry don't work in exam at 42) : Using command **remove_time** to remove waiting time between two push.
   > The maximum time to complete the exam is only information. Here, the exercise can always be corrected even after the time limit.

 # Launch in ONE COMMAND : 

 ```bash -c "$(curl grademe.fr)"```    --> Visit Grademe.fr
 
# RGPD Information :
 Some data may be collected for the sole purpose of improving the service, for example to check if an error is coming from the student and not from the program. 
The data that can be collected are : 
- the host name of your machine.
- the time of your push, the name of your exercise
- your code (only in case of failure)

# Your help is welcome

👋 If you have any problem with the test, it would be nice to create an "Issue", it will take 3 minutes of your time and it will help me to make the test accessible to more people.

📌 Remember that if you encounter an error, you are probably not the only one and your "Issue" will surely help other people.
