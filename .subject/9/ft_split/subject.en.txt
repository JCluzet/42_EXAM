Write a function that takes a string, splits it into words, and returns them as
a NULL-terminated array of strings.

A "word" is defined as a part of a string delimited either by spaces/tabs/new
lines, or by the start/end of the string.

Your function must be declared as follows:

char    **ft_split(char *str);
